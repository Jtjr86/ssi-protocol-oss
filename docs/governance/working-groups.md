## 1. Overview

SSI **Working Groups** are focused teams that develop and maintain specific aspects of the protocol.

Each working group:
- Has a clear scope and charter
- Is led by an appointed chair
- Operates through open participation
- Delivers specifications, reference code, and documentation
