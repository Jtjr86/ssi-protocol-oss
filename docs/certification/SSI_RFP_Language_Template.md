## 2. SSI Conformance Levels (Overview)

SSI Protocol defines three conformance levels with increasing rigor:

### 2.1. Level 1 (L1): Hash Integrity

**What It Means:**  
Every decision is cryptographically logged with tamper-evident hashing.

**Verification:**  
- Decision chain exists in RPX format (JSONL)
- Each record has valid SHA-256 hash
- Hash computation follows canonical rules

**Use Cases:**  
- Basic audit trail requirements
- Development/testing environments
- Internal compliance monitoring

### 2.2. Level 2 (L2): Chain Continuity

**What It Means:**  
L1 + decisions form unbroken cryptographic chain from system initialization.

**Verification:**
- All L1 requirements
- Chain starts with genesis record
- Each record links to previous via `prev_hash`
- No gaps, forks, or missing records

**Use Cases:**
- Production deployments
- Regulatory submissions (FDA, NHTSA, SOX)
- High-stakes decision systems

### 2.3. Level 3 (L3): Governance Binding

**What It Means:**  
L2 + decisions cryptographically bound to versioned governance policies.

**Verification:**
- All L1 + L2 requirements
- Governance envelopes include policy hashes
- Policy changes create new envelope records
- Decision-to-policy lineage is unbroken

**Use Cases:**
- Safety-critical systems (ISO 26262, DO-178C)
- Regulated AI (EU AI Act Article 14)
- Procurement requiring policy auditability

---

## 3. General Procurement Considerations

Organizations considering SSI requirements in RFPs SHOULD evaluate:

### 3.1. Conformance Level Selection

**Risk-Based Selection:**

| Risk Level | Recommended Level | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Low (non-critical) | L1 | Basic audit trail |
| Medium (production) | L2 | Chain continuity required |
| High (safety/regulated) | L3 | Policy binding required |

**Sector-Specific Guidance:**
- Financial services: L2 minimum (SOX, MiFID II)
- Healthcare: L2-L3 (HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11)
- Autonomous systems: L3 (ISO 26262, EU AI Act)
- General AI: L1-L2 (depends on criticality)

See [sector-mappings/](sector-mappings/) for detailed regulatory analysis.

### 3.2. Vendor Deliverables

At minimum, vendors claiming SSI conformance SHOULD provide:

1. **Decision Chain Artifacts**
   - RPX chain file(s) in JSONL format
   - Covering evaluation period or deployment scope

2. **Verification Report**
   - Generated by ssi-verify CLI or SSI Certified Auditor
   - Showing PASS at claimed conformance level
   - Including tamper evidence findings (if any)

3. **Technical Documentation**
   - How SSI logging is integrated
   - What decisions are captured
   - Chain generation procedures

**Evidence Bundle Format:**  
See [SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md](SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md) for standardized packaging.

### 3.3. Verification Approach

**Option 1: Self-Verification (Basic)**
- Vendor runs ssi-verify CLI themselves
- Suitable for low-risk procurement
- No third-party validation

**Option 2: Independent Verification (Recommended)**
- Procurement team runs ssi-verify on vendor artifacts
- Reproduces verification report independently
- Requires technical capability

**Option 3: SSI Certified Auditor (High-Assurance)**
- Third-party certification by SSI Protocol Authority-recognized auditor
- Formal attestation of conformance
- Required for safety-critical or regulated contexts
- Available through SSI Enterprise Program

### 3.4. Acceptance Criteria Examples

**Basic Pass/Fail (Low-Risk):**
- Vendor MUST provide decision chain in RPX format
- Chain MUST pass ssi-verify at L1 or higher
- No INVALID findings permitted

**Rigorous (High-Risk):**
- Vendor MUST achieve L2 or L3 conformance
- Verification MUST be performed by SSI Certified Auditor
- Evidence bundle MUST be complete (no missing artifacts)
- Tamper evidence findings MUST be ACCEPTABLE or better

**Weighted Scoring (Competitive RFP):**
- Award points for conformance level (L1: 5pt, L2: 10pt, L3: 15pt)
- Award points for verification method (self: 0pt, independent: 5pt, certified: 10pt)
- Award points for evidence quality (completeness, timeliness, documentation)

## 9. Appendix A: Sample RFP Clauses

### 9.1. Short Form (paragraph)

**[Use for lightweight procurements or addendums]**

> **SSI Protocol Conformance:** Vendor's proposed solution shall generate audit logs conforming to SSI Protocol Specification v1.0 or higher, achieving minimum conformance level L1 (Integrity Verification). Vendor shall submit an Evidence Bundle (as defined in SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md) with technical proposal, demonstrating successful verification by ssi-verify CLI tool. Non-conformance is grounds for proposal disqualification.

### 9.2. Long Form (full section)

**[Use for comprehensive RFPs with detailed technical requirements]**

> **SECTION X: SSI PROTOCOL CONFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS**
>
> **X.1. Overview**  
> The proposed AI system shall conform to the Sovereign Synthetic Intelligence (SSI) Protocol Specification version 1.0 or higher, as documented at https://github.com/Jtjr86/ssi-protocol-oss. SSI conformance enables independent verification of AI decision integrity, governance transparency, and audit trail tamper-evidence.
>
> **X.2. Mandatory Technical Requirements**  
> Vendor's solution SHALL:
> - Generate RPX-formatted decision audit logs (JSONL)
> - Compute SHA-256 hashes for every decision record
> - Maintain cryptographic hash chain linking records
> - Support export of complete Evidence Bundles
> - Achieve conformance level: [L1 Integrity | L2 Continuity | L3 Governance]
>
> **X.3. Verification & Submission**  
> Vendor SHALL submit Evidence Bundle with technical proposal containing:
> - chain.jsonl: Decision chain with minimum 1,000 records covering 30+ days
> - verification-report.json: Output of ssi-verify tool showing VALID status
> - cover-sheet.json: Bundle metadata per SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md
> - README.md: Human-readable summary of Evidence Bundle contents
>
> **X.4. Evaluation Criteria**  
> SSI conformance will be scored (100 points total):
> - Conformance Level Achieved: 50 points (L1), 75 points (L2), 100 points (L3)
> - Evidence Quality: Up to 30 points based on chain length, time span, findings
> - Integration Maturity: Up to 20 points for automated export, real-time logging
>
> **X.5. Disqualification**  
> Proposals will be automatically disqualified if Evidence Bundle verification fails, contains critical findings, or is incomplete/missing.
>
> **X.6. Acceptance Criteria**  
> Evidence Bundle is accepted if and only if ssi-verify exits with code 0, reports `integrity_status: "VALID"`, and achieves required conformance level with zero critical findings.

### 9.3. Lightweight Variant (proof-of-concept)

**[Use for pilots, demos, or low-risk procurements]**

> **SSI Demonstration Requirement:** Vendor shall provide a demonstration Evidence Bundle showing SSI Protocol conformance at Level L1 (minimum). Bundle may be generated from test/staging environment and contain as few as 100 decision records. The purpose is to demonstrate Vendor's understanding of SSI requirements and technical capability to achieve conformance. Full production conformance is not required for this procurement phase.
