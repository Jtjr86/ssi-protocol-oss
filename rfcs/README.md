# SSI RFC Archive (Pre-Governance)

**Status:** 🟡 **INFORMATIONAL INTAKE ONLY** — No Decision Authority Active

---

## Purpose

SSI accepts **informational and experimental RFCs** to understand ecosystem needs and technical evolution patterns. This is a **signal collection phase**, not a governance phase.

## Current State

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Decision Authority | ❌ None exists |
| Approval Process | ❌ Not operational |
| RFC Submissions | ✅ Accepted for archival |
| Community Discussion | ✅ Encouraged |
| Binding Commitments | ❌ None made |

---

## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimer

**No governance structure currently exists.**

- RFCs submitted now are **archived only**
- No approvals, rejections, or implementation commitments will be made
- Submissions may inform future protocol evolution
- Contributors retain all rights to their proposals
- SSI makes no guarantee of consideration or response

**This process creates NO obligations for SSI or contributors.**

---

## RFC Categories (Informational Only)

### **Informational RFC**
Documents describing SSI-related patterns, use cases, or ecosystem observations. No protocol changes proposed.

### **Experimental RFC**
Proposes experimental extensions or alternative approaches for community evaluation. Not binding on protocol evolution.

### **Standards Track** (FUTURE)
Reserved for when formal governance exists. Not accepted currently.

---

## Submission Process

### 1. Fork Repository
Fork the SSI Protocol repository on GitHub.

### 2. Create RFC File
Copy `rfcs/0000-template.md` to `rfcs/0000-your-title.md`

### 3. Fill Template
Complete all required sections with technical detail.

### 4. Submit Pull Request
Open PR with title: `RFC: [Your Title]`

Label: `rfc-informational` or `rfc-experimental`

### 5. Community Discussion
Discussion happens in PR comments. No formal review process exists.

### 6. Archival
Accepted PRs are merged into `rfcs/archive/` directory for historical record. This is **not approval** — only acknowledgment of receipt.

## RFC Template Structure

```markdown
# RFC-XXXX: [Title]

- **Status:** Informational / Experimental
- **Author(s):** [Name(s)]
- **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Category:** [Technical / Process / Ecosystem]

## Abstract
3-5 sentence summary

## Motivation
Why does this matter?

## Specification
Technical details (for experimental RFCs)

## Rationale
Design decisions and trade-offs

## Backwards Compatibility
Impact on existing implementations

## Security Considerations
Safety and security implications

## Open Questions
Unresolved issues

## References
Related work, standards, research
```

## What Happens to Submitted RFCs?

**Current Reality:**
- Archived in repository
- Available for community reference
- May inform future protocol decisions
- **No implementation commitment**

**Future (When Governance Exists):**
- Formal review process
- Working group evaluation
- Approval/rejection with rationale
- Implementation scheduling

**Timeline for governance formation:** Unknown. Depends on ecosystem adoption and external pull.

---

## Why This Exists Now

This RFC intake system serves three purposes:

1. **Signal Collection:** Test whether ecosystem has governance needs
2. **Community Building:** Enable early contributors to participate
3. **Preparation:** Create foundation for future formal governance

**It does NOT:**
- Create governance authority
- Make implementation promises
- Establish working groups
- Form decision-making bodies

---

## Sovereignty Protection

**What SSI Retains:**
- Full protocol evolution authority
- Implementation roadmap control
- Governance timing decisions
- Strategic positioning

**What Contributors Retain:**
- Full rights to their proposals
- Ability to withdraw submissions
- Independence from SSI decisions

**Neither party creates obligations through this process.**

---

## Contact

For questions about RFC submissions:
- GitHub Discussions: [Repository Discussions Tab]
- Issues: [Repository Issues] (tag: `rfc-question`)

**No email, no committees, no meetings.**

Everything happens in public, asynchronously, non-binding.

---

## Governance Formation Triggers

This pre-governance phase will transition to formal governance when **external pull** demonstrates need:

**Potential triggers:**
- 5+ quality RFCs from independent organizations
- 3+ production implementations requesting coordination
- Standards body engagement requiring formal liaison
- Regulatory requests for governance structure

**Current count:** 0 RFCs submitted

**Decision authority:** SSI retains full discretion on governance formation timing.

🛡️ **Sovereign-safe. Non-binding. Signal-collecting.**
