- **Author(s):** [Your Name] <email@example.com>
- **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Category:** Technical | Process | Ecosystem | Security

## Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of this RFC. What problem does it address? What is the proposed solution?

---

## Motivation

**Why does this RFC exist?**

Describe the problem, use case, or opportunity this RFC addresses. What gaps exist in the current SSI Protocol? Why should the community care?

---

## Specification

**Technical Details (Required for Experimental RFCs)**

Provide detailed technical specification:

- New data structures or message formats
- Protocol changes or extensions
- Algorithm or process definitions
- Interface specifications
- Wire format changes

Use precise language. Include examples.

*(Informational RFCs may describe existing patterns instead of proposing changes)*

---

## Rationale

**Design Decisions**

Explain why you made specific design choices:

- Why this approach over alternatives?
- What trade-offs were considered?
- How does this align with SSI principles?
- What are the benefits and costs?

---

## Backwards Compatibility

**Impact on Existing Implementations**

- Does this RFC break existing SSI implementations?
- What migration path exists for adopters?
- Can old and new versions interoperate?
- What is the upgrade strategy?

---

## Security Considerations

**Safety and Security Implications**

All RFCs must address security:

- New attack surfaces introduced
- Cryptographic implications
- Privacy considerations
- Safety boundary impacts
- Audit trail changes

If "no security impact," explain why.

---

## Implementation Considerations

**Practical Deployment Issues**

- Complexity of implementation
- Performance implications
- Testing strategy
- Rollout approach
- Operational concerns

---

## Alternatives Considered

**Why Not Other Approaches?**

Describe alternatives you evaluated and rejected:

- Alternative designs
- Existing solutions in other protocols
- Why they were insufficient

---

## Open Questions

**Unresolved Issues**

What questions remain unanswered?

- Technical uncertainties
- Need for community input
- Future work required
- Dependencies on other decisions

---

## References

**Related Work**

- Related SSI RFCs
- External standards (IETF, W3C, ISO)
- Research papers
- Existing implementations
- Prior art

---

## Appendix (Optional)

**Supporting Material**

- Code examples
- Detailed algorithms
- Test vectors
- Compatibility matrices
- Performance benchmarks

---

**Submission Notes:**

- Replace all `[bracketed]` placeholders
- Remove sections that don't apply
- Add sections if needed for clarity
- Keep total length reasonable (2000-5000 words typical)

**Remember:** This is INFORMATIONAL ONLY. No governance exists. No approval process active.
